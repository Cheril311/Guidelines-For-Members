1. Setting up Anaconda for your PC.
(Refer to any youtube video if you get stuck or else you can use Google Collab)

Step 1: Download Anaconda
Anaconda is a free and easy-to-use environment for scientific Python.

Use this link to download Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Step 2: Install Anaconda

In this step, we will install the Anaconda Python software on your system.
Installation is very easy and quick once you download the setup. Open the setup and follow the wizard instructions.
#Note: It will automatically install Python and some basic libraries with it.
It might take 5 to 10 minutes or some more time according to your system.

Step 3: Update Anaconda

Open Anaconda Prompt to type the following command(s). Don’t worry, Anaconda Prompt works the same as cmd.

conda update conda
conda update --all



Note: You can launch jupyter notebook using Anaconda Navigator
